## Model Details
### faster_rcnn_sim
This model is optimized to classify simulator images. This model is based on [Faster R-CNN Resnet 101](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5638-faster-r-cnn-towards-real-time-object-detection-with-region-proposal-networks.pdf) model architecture and created using TensorFlow's Object Detection API. Model is first trained using [Bosch Small traffic Light Data set](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/6132) and then fine tuned for a hand annotated set of images from the Udacity Simulator.
#### Model Params:
epochs : 10000
learning rate : 0.0003
